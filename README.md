# Trying-Mini-Pacman-
After learning some sfml basics i tried to create a mini 1 level game as a task and here is how it went 
Learned from some mistakes i made during this task:
1- As creating all the coins independently before knowing that we can put them all in an array.
2-Collision with coins "No need to add collision from all directions".
And many other mistakes i made during this very first task<>
